# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains a selection of my projects, demonstrating my skills in SQL, Python, and Power BI across different domains.

* Marketing Campaign Analysis (SQL & Power BI): Focused on data exploration and visualization of campaign performance, highlighting insights on customer engagement and conversion.
* Medical Prediction Model (Python): Logistic regression model for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) prediction, optimized for recall to minimize false negatives. Includes full data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, and evaluation metrics (ROCâ€“AUC, precision/recall trade-offs).

Each project includes clear documentation and reproducible workflows. I created this portfolio to showcase my ability to analyze, model, and communicate insights from complex datasets.
